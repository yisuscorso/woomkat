            <h3>How we protect your data</h3>
            <p>Digital Data solutions has taken technical, organisational and physical security measures to ensure that the data you share with us is protected against all forms of unlawful processing. Examples are: accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised use, unauthorised modification, disclosure and/or access.
            
            For safety and security reasons we cannot disclose the specific measures we have taken. A few broad examples are set out </p>
            
            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>This means that we have processes and measures in place to protect your personal data against unintentional, unlawful, or unauthorised access disclosure or theft.
            
            All our personnel are subject to full confidentiality and any third parties hired are obliged to sign a confidentiality agreement if the full confidentiality is not part of the main agreement. All data we process is encrypted to align with best practices for protecting confidentiality and data integrity.
            
            Data is encrypted with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and data which are no longer necessary are destroyed without undue delay. When personal data is accessed by authorised personnel the access is only possible over an encrypted connection. All devices used by personnel have antivirus software.</p>
            
            <h4>Integrity</h4>
            <p>This means that we have processes and measures in place for the maintenance of, and the assurance of, data accuracy and consistency. Access to personal information is only possible on a need to know basis and there are processes in place for identification and authentication of persons wanting access. There are also processes in place for erasure or rectification of incorrect information.</p>
            
            <h4>Availability</h4>
            <p>This means that we have processes and measures in place to ensure the timeliness and reliability of access to and use of data. We use the extensive features of the cloud environment to ensure high availability, like full redundancy, load balancing, automatic capacity scaling, continuous data backup and geo-replication along with a traffic manager for automatic geographical failover on datacenter level disasters. All failover mechanisms are fully automated.
            
            All data centers where your personal information is stored are within the EU and comply with industry standards such as ISO270001 for physical security and availability. For example, by using 24h security staff, two-factor authentication, barriers, fencing, and security cameras.</p>
            
            <h4>Data breach notification</h4>
            <p>We do our best to prevent any kind of unauthorised access to your personal data. In the event that your data is compromised, we have internal procedures and policies on how to handle these situations. We will notify you and the competent Supervisory Authority(ies) within 72 hours with information about the extent of the breach, affected data, any impact on our services and our plan for measures to secure the data, and limit any further negative effects on the data subjects.</p>
